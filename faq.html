            <li>
                <h4><b>How long have you been programming?</b></h4>
                <p>I've been programming for over 5 years now, and developed a strong understanding on how game engines work. I've mostly gotten experience in working with low-level programming for game-engines.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>What languages do you know?</b></h4>
                <p>Over my years of programming I've developed a wide range of skills in programming languages, such as C# as I mostly use Unity. I also worked on a niche engine called BYOND, which has an awkward programming language called DM, I've developed most of my skills from it, which is easily transferable to other programming languages. It functions like C++ and has the formatting similar to Python. I'm planning on learning Python, and when I'm studying in University, I'll be learning mostly C++ and some high level programming later on.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Have you ever worked as a games programmer?</b></h4>
                <p>I haven't gotten a job in games programming yet, I've been working somewhat like a freelancer where I do tasks for friends/people when they offer money, but most of my projects/work I do is voluntary as I really enjoy programming and learning new techniques in programming.</p>
